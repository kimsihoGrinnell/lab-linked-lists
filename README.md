MINI PROJECT 9
================

Code for implementing linked lists with a dummy node and a circular structure. Doing this enables me to remove lots of special cases (I only have the normal case in the add method, whereas before I had 2 special cases) and get around lots of potential errors/exceptions that might result from them.
